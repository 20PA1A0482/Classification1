Classification of Skin Cancer Using CNN with Transformer Layer
Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer globally, and it's early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Traditional methods of skin cancer classification often rely on manual examination by dermatologists, which can be time-consuming and subject to human error.
Different CNN techniques have been developed over the last few years and have achieved success in helping to improve the accuracy of classification.
This project explores the integration of transformer layers within a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to enhance the accuracy of skin cancer classification.
 Our approach aims to provide a robust model for comprehensive skin disease classification.
The transformer layer is introduced to capture intricate spatial dependencies and improve feature extraction, complementing the strengths of traditional CNNs.
